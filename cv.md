## ***About myself***

I worked as a bank customer service specialist in Belarus for 10 years. Focus on results and communication skills allowed me to implement sales plans. Ð¡urrently I work in the payment department of the large transport company in Poland and in my free time I continue to improve my programming skills. I believe, that my ability to learn quickly and effectively will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
